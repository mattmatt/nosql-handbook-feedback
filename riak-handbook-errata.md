* Page  8: "there's the occasional assumption that some piece of code earlier code has been run at some point."; "code" should only be there once.

* Page 11: "The first R nodes to return the requested alue"; should be "value"
* Page 11: "The optimum for consistency lies i choosing"; should be "in"
* Page 14: "In a truly distributed environment, and when rites involve quorums"; "rites" should be "writes"
